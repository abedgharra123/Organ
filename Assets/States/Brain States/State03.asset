  Title: The human brain - senses
  DataText: 'All our senses are important but there is no doubt that the senses of
    sight, hearing and touch provide our brain with most of the information from
    the outside world.

    Can we imagine doing a daily action that will impair
    our vision? God forbid! But many of us constantly hear music at a volume that
    is harmful to the ear and impairs our ability to hear.'
