  Title: Sound
  DataText: Here is a scatter that includes terms we have learned in lessons so far.
    Divide into groups of 4 students (or zoom rooms). Each student will find a term
    within the bulk and explain it to his friends. This way we can learn whether
    the terms we have learned are clear to us.
