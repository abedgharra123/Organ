  Title: Wavelength
  DataText: 'There are different types of waves. For example: when we throw a stone
    into the water, circles of waves are formed. These waves are called latitude
    waves.


    Sound waves are longitudinal waves and therefore, we measure the
    wavelength. The unit of measurement of wavelength is meters.'
