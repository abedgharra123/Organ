  Title: amplitude
  DataText: 'The amplitude describes the nature of the sound waves and is related
    to the volume of the sound heard.


    The zero point is the air pressure (atmospheric
    pressure) that was before the "interference" of the sound waves - that is, the
    point where it was "quiet".


    The amplitude of the wave starts from the zero
    point, rises to the positive peak of the wave, returns to the zero point and
    drops to the negative peak. (This waveform is called sine waves).'
