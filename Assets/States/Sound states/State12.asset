  Title: Doppler effect
  DataText: 'The effect that controls all these phenomena is called the Doppler effect,
    after the Austrian mathematician Christian Andreas Doppler - who predicted the
    phenomenon in 1842. Simply put, when we approach a source of waves, or it approaches
    us, more ''peaks'' of waves will reach us compared to a state of motionlessness
    In the same period of time. As we move away from the source of the waves - fewer
    ''peaks'' of waves will reach us compared to a state of immobility. The number
    of peaks that come in a certain period of time is called the frequency of the
    wave. The effect is present in every wavy phenomenon - even in water waves -
    as shown in the video, and also in sound waves. When it comes to sound waves,
    an increase or decrease in frequency means an increase or decrease in the pitch
    of the sound heard.


    The effect also exists in electromagnetic waves, and
    is especially evident in light waves, which are also a type of electromagnetic
    radiation. An increase or decrease in frequency means a change in the color of
    the light. In light waves very high velocities are required to notice the phenomenon,
    so a Doppler effect is useful in astrophysics and allows us to know if a star
    or galaxy is approaching us or moving away from us: . If the color of the star
    looks bluish than usual - it is said that its light is diverted to blue, which
    means that the star is moving towards us - because blue light is more frequent.'
