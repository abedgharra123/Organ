  Title: Math in Sound
  DataText: The wavelength is actually the unit of measurement of the speed of wave
    motion in the air, and it depends on the material within which the wave is moving
    and conditions such as temperature and atmospheric pressure. The calculation
    of the "wavelength" The speed of sound is around 343 meters per second, or 1230
    km / h. The wavelength is its propagation speed divided by the frequency.
